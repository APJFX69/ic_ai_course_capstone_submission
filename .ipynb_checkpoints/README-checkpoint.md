## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
WE are building a model that classifies product description provided by clients into classes dependingon the positivity of the review. Based on that the model recommends an action (prioritisation for the respective sales person to reach ou to client).

## DATA

First source is a fictional company CRM data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innocentmfa/crm-sales-opportunities?select=sales_pipeline.csv)
